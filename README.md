# PandaPi
3d printer firmware run on raspberryPi and control printer directly. for increasing print speed and smooth. 
control 3D printer directly,except the temperature control which is just to maintain the temperature.

1)the GPIO being able to signal at 10+ Mhz for the 2B+ as compared to 8/32bit MCU limit of about 10Khz/200khz for steps.
Test results:
3.5Mhz GPIO test on RPi3+
750Khz run marlin on RPi3+
2)Real Time linux kernel
3)opensource. 
4)it can work with Octoprint in one raspberryPi.

thans for your like/following or buy board, I need your help so this project can go long way.
